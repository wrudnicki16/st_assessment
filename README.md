I wasn't able to get everything working, but I can say what I planned to do, which after getting 
my pages linked together was to use a countdown timer that is saved and modified in localStorage. 

My routes were giving me trouble, but I was getting some things to save.

I used an index for emails so if we wanted to find a specific person's answers we could do this 
quickly with the most unique element of the user.

I didn't get to making the static pages as I felt that once I had one page the rest would be 
pretty self explanatory, so I figured I'd try to work on the routes instead.
